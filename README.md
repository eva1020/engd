You can install a released version of Ansible with pip or a package manager. See our installation guide for details on installing Ansible on a variety of platforms.

Power users and developers can run the devel branch, which has the latest features and fixes, directly. Although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter breaking changes when running the devel branch. We recommend getting involved in the Ansible community if you want to run the devel branch.

Get Involved
Read Community Information for all kinds of ways to contribute to and interact with the project, including mailing list information and how to submit bug reports and code to Ansible.
Join a Working Group, an organized community devoted to a specific technology domain or platform.
Submit a proposed code update through a pull request to the devel branch.
Talk to us before making larger changes to avoid duplicate efforts. This not only helps everyone know what is going on, but it also helps save time and effort if we decide some changes are needed.
For a list of email lists, IRC channels and Working Groups, see the Communication page
Coding Guidelines
We document our Coding Guidelines in the Developer Guide. We particularly suggest you review:

Conventions, tips, and pitfalls
Branch Info
The devel branch corresponds to the release actively under development.
The stable-2.X branches correspond to stable releases.
Create a branch based on devel and set up a dev environment if you want to open a PR.
See the Ansible release and maintenance page for information about active branches.
Roadmap
Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (ex: 2.7, 2.8). The Ansible Roadmap page details what is planned and how to influence the roadmap.
